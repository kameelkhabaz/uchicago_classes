Q1: 

A. The relevant entry in the exception table
built into the hardware is below. 

Exc# | Exception handler addresses
-----------------------------------
0    | 0xC0015200 

B. Here, %eip is the program counter, which tracks the address of the 
instruction currently being executed at each time. Since %eip is 0x08031000, 
the CPU starts executing the instructions starting at address 0x08031000. 
Since the instruction representing “idivl %ebx” is at this address, 
and %ebx is 0, the instruction at this address is to divide by 0. From the
circuitry in the CPU, the ALU (arithmetic logic unit) detects a division by
0. This triggers a lookup in the exception table (which is built in the 
CPU) at exception number 0 (which indicates a division by 0 error). The hardware 
gets the exception handler address of 0xC0015200 from the table. The 
program counter jumps to that address (%eip = 0xC0015200), and the CPU 
executes the exception handler divideByZero.
